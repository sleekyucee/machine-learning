# Machine Learning for Insurance Policy Prediction

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository dedicated to predicting which insurance policyholders are likely to be interested in a new offering—vehicle insurance. In the dynamic field of insurance, understanding customer needs is paramount. This project employs two machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression, to address this challenge.

## Project Overview

In collaboration with an insurance company, this project aims to leverage demographic information, vehicle details, policy data, and more to predict which customers from the past year would be interested in the new type of insurance—vehicle insurance. The predictive models built as part of this project will assist the client in tailoring their marketing strategies, optimizing revenue, and better serving their customers.

## Algorithms Used

The repository showcases the application of two machine learning algorithms:

- **Decision Tree Classifier:** A tree-like model that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets based on different conditions. It's used for classification problems.

- **Logistic Regression:** Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It models the probability of the default class (in this case, interest or no interest in vehicle insurance).

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for the project:
  - `predicting_insurance_policy.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the code and detailed analysis.
  - `predicting_insurance_policy.pdf`: PDF version for easy review.

- **datasets/:** Includes the dataset files:
  - `train.csv`: Training dataset.
  - `test.csv`: Test dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the machine learning models and their applications.
2. Refer to the dataset files in `datasets/` for the training and test datasets.
